Compile Command:
$ ./compile.sh


Run Command for experiment 1 (ordered.txt, random.txt, reverse.txt):
$ java -cp bin SortDriver <input file>

Run Command for Experiment 2 (to get the plots with different inputs):
$ ./experimentRun.sh

References:
I got all the sorting algorithms except quickSort_fp and quickSort_rp from the slides.
I found a java implementation of quickSort_fp from a book called
Object-Oriented Data Structures using Java 4ed by Nell Dale, Daniel T. Joyce, Chip Weems,
published by Jones & Bartlett Learning. The algorithm is on page 648 and 650. A lot of it
was similar to the slides code. I also adapted that version to the quickSort_rp.
